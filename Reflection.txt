1. Why do we use BrowserRouter in main.jsx instead App.jsx?
    A. main.jsx is the top level of the website, and we want it to apply to all of it, that is why we use it in main.
2. What would happen if you forgot to use element = {<Component />} in your Route?
    A. the website would not know where to send you when routing, so you might end up somewhere different or an error might come out.
3. What does UseNavigate() do under the hood?
    A. manipulates the nacigation bar, and uses it to change the website and use the values from the navigation.
4. Why do we need to wrap the navigate() call inside a handleSubmit function?
    A. we want the call navigate after the submit button has been pressed, that is why its inside the handleSubmit function.
5. What would happen if you forgot to call e.preventDefault()?
    A. the default submit function will apply and the website will not behave the way we want to.
6. What happens if you leave [] out of the useEffect dependency array?
    A. the [] tell the useEffect to run when the variables inside change after render, in this case there is not much change, but in other websites it would stop the website from auto-updating whenever you change values.
7. Why do we convert .from and .to to lowercase when comparing?
    A. to minimize user error, we could also use to uppercase to compare.
8. How would you modify this to show all flights from a location (ignoring destination)?
    A. add if statement when to is empty and show all that share the same from value.
9. What would happen if you passed flights to FlightCard instead of flight?
    A. FlightCard would not work with array, so it would give back something that is not usable.
10. How would you modify FlightCard to show a "Book Now" button?
    A. add a button tag at the bottom of the flight information so each card has their own button.
